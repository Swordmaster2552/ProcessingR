ProcessingR
==========
A Processing Fork with JavaScript Preprocessor

In Java Mode, this build of Processing ignores any code between the following tags:
```
/* @startJS */
Put incompatible Javascript stuff here.
/* @endJS */
```
Downloads:
Copy the .exe into your current processing folder and it should be able to run.
**Windows only for now. I don't have the knowhow or hardware to build for OSX and Linux.
